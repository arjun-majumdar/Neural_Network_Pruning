# Neural Network Pruning

Implementations of different neural network pruning techniques based on the following research papers:

- "Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks" by Song Han et al.
- "Deep Compression" by Song Han et al.
- ["The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis"](https://github.com/arjun-majumdar/Lottery_Ticket_Hypothesis-TensorFlow_2) by Jonathan Frankle et al.
- "What is the State of Neural Network Pruning" by Davis Blalock et al.
